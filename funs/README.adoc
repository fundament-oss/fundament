= FUN Workflow

== Adding a New FUN

1. *Find the next FUN number* by checking existing directories in `funs/`

2. *Create a branch and add your FUN:*
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b FUN-42
mkdir -p funs/0042
----

3. *Create `funs/0042/FUN-42.adoc`* with this template:
+
[source,asciidoc]
----
:showtitle:
:toc: left
:numbered:
:icons: font
:state: prediscussion

= FUN-42 Your Title Here

== Introduction

What this FUN proposes.

== Proposal

Details of the proposal.
----

4. *Commit, push, and create a PR:*
+
[source,bash]
----
git add funs/0042/
git commit -m "FUN-42: Your title"
git push -u origin FUN-42
----
+
Then create a PR to `master`.

That's it! The FUN is now tracked and can be discussed.

== FUN States

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| State | Description

| prediscussion | Initial draft, before discussion
| discussion | Actively being discussed
| published | Approved
| committed | Implementation delivered

FUNs can be added in any state, but `prediscussion` is preferred for new FUNs.

* *To publish:* Change state to `published`, get approval, merge the PR
* *To mark as implemented:* Change state to `committed`
* *To abandon:* Change state to `abandoned`

== Updating a Published FUN

Create a new branch (`FUN-42`), make changes, create a PR, get approval, merge.
