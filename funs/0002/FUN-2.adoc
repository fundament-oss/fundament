== Assumptions

* Tenants are friends
** Live within the same company or broader organization
** Preference to have tenants start in the same starting point
* Tenants make mistakes (so isolation is definitely required)

* Opinionated configuration of metal-stack+gardener for multi-tentant usage
* Strong opinions on 'how these clusters work', lowering complexity and increasing interoperability.
* User-friendly click-ops management
* Developer-friendly infra-as-code and CLI
