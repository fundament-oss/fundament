= FUN-13 Personas

== Introduction

This document defines the personas used throughout Fundament's design and development. Personas are fictional but representative users drawn from the seed data used in local development. They provide a shared vocabulary for discussions about features, access control, and user experience.

Each persona belongs to one of three fictional tenant organizations: *Acme Corp*, *Globex*, and *Initech*. Within each organization, users hold either the `admin` or `viewer` role.

== Personas

| Name | Organization | Role

| Alice Johnson | Acme Corp | admin

| Carol White | Acme Corp | viewer
| David Brown | Globex | admin
| Eve Davis | Globex | viewer
| Frank Miller | Initech | admin
| Grace Lee | Initech | viewer

NOTE: The authorization model also supports _project-level_ membership (project admin and project viewer), which scopes access to a single project rather than the whole organization. No seed data exists for these roles yet; candidate personas are listed in <<_to_be_added>>.

== Persona Descriptions

=== Alice Johnson — Acme Corp admin

Alice is the platform owner at Acme Corp. She was responsible for onboarding her organization into Fundament and continues to manage day-to-day platform operations. Alice provisions new clusters for her development teams, installs plugins from the appstore, and maintains the user roster — including inviting new colleagues and assigning appropriate roles. When a new product team spins up, Alice is the one creating their project and granting access.

=== Bob Smith — Acme Corp viewer

Bob is a backend engineer at Acme Corp. He uses Fundament primarily to understand the state of the clusters his services run on — checking which plugins are active, reviewing cluster health, and looking up configuration details when debugging production issues. Bob cannot make changes himself; when he identifies something that needs updating, he raises it with Alice.

=== Carol White — Acme Corp viewer

Carol works in operations at Acme Corp. She regularly checks cluster status and installed plugin versions to ensure the environment meets compliance requirements. Carol is particularly interested in the observability stack — she cross-references what is installed in Fundament with dashboards in Grafana to confirm that telemetry pipelines are functioning correctly.

=== David Brown — Globex admin

David is the sole platform administrator at Globex, a smaller organization with fewer clusters but strict security requirements. He uses Fundament to manage the complete lifecycle of Globex's clusters, including selecting plugins from the appstore with a focus on security tooling such as cert-manager and Sealed Secrets. David periodically reviews the list of users in his organization and revokes access for departed employees.

=== Eve Davis — Globex viewer

Eve is a data engineer at Globex. She interacts with Fundament primarily to verify that the database infrastructure — specifically CloudNativePG clusters — is available and properly configured. She does not manage the platform herself but relies on the Fundament UI to get a quick overview before directing more detailed queries to David.

=== Frank Miller — Initech admin

Frank manages the Initech platform team and uses Fundament to coordinate infrastructure across several clusters. He is a power user of the appstore: he frequently evaluates new plugins, consults their documentation, and decides which ones to roll out to his organization. Frank also manages the Initech user directory in Fundament, ensuring the right people have the right level of access.

=== Grace Lee — Initech viewer

Grace is a security analyst at Initech. She uses Fundament to audit the set of installed plugins across clusters, verifying that only approved software is running in the environment. Grace pays particular attention to identity and secrets management plugins such as Keycloak and Sealed Secrets. When she spots a gap, she reports it to Frank so he can take action.

[[_to_be_added]]
== To be added

The following personas cover access patterns not represented by the seed users above. They should be defined and added to seed data in a future iteration.

=== Dev — project viewer (scoped access)

A developer who has been invited directly to a single project by a project admin. This user has no organization-level role and therefore cannot see other projects, clusters, or organization members. They interact with Fundament exclusively through the lens of their project: browsing its namespaces, checking which plugins are available in the cluster, and looking up cluster configuration relevant to their workload. This is the most common access pattern for developers in larger organizations where not everyone should have org-wide visibility.

=== Team Lead — project admin (scoped access)

A senior engineer or team lead who owns a project within a cluster but is not an organization admin. They can manage their project's members (invite colleagues, adjust roles), create and manage namespaces, and view the cluster resources that back their project. They do not have visibility into other teams' projects or into organization-wide settings such as the user roster or appstore plugin management. This persona exercises the project-level authorization boundaries distinct from both the org-admin and the project-viewer.

=== Fundament Operator — platform staff

A member of the team that runs the Fundament platform itself (not a tenant). The operator interacts with Fundament through `funops`, the privileged operator CLI, rather than through the regular API or UI. Typical tasks include bootstrapping new installations, performing database maintenance, and investigating incidents that require direct access below the RLS layer. This persona has no organization membership in any tenant; their access bypasses the normal OpenFGA authorization model entirely and is controlled through separate operational credentials.
