# Contributing to Fundament

Welcome, fellow developer! Happy to see you're interested to join the fun.

Please follow these guidelines in your contributions.

## NeRDS

This project follows the [Nederlandse Richtlijn Digitale Systemen (NeRDS)](https://minbzk.github.io/NeRDS/production/richtlijnen/) as a baseline for quality and consistency.

In practice, there may be situations where we take a pragmatic approach and deviate from these guidelines. Such deviations are acceptable when they serve the projectâ€™s needs.

## Workflow

We accept contributions from developers and users through GitHub PRs.

## Technologies

Do not introduce a new programming language or tech-stack dependency without prior discussion and approval.

## Styling

### Markdown

- Use [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
- Use a single line per paragraph. If you prefer text to be wrapped, use soft-wrapping in your text editor.
