    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 sm:text-xl dark:text-gray-300">
      Fundament is software for running an Autonomous Private Cloud. It is designed to provide
      organizations with a minimal, reliable foundation for running modern applications. Unlike
      traditional platforms that bundle every service by default, Fundament is basic at its core
      &mdash;delivering only the essential infrastructure and orchestration layers&mdash; while
      allowing each tenant to extend their environment with exactly the services and tools they
      need.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 sm:text-xl dark:text-gray-300">
      On top of this foundation, Fundament serves as an internal developer platform (IDP):
      enabling developers to build, deploy, and operate applications with speed and confidence.
      Its API-first design, multi-tenant architecture, and focus on autonomy and scalability
      make it suitable for organizations that want cloud capabilities on their own terms;
      secure, reliable, and without unnecessary complexity.
